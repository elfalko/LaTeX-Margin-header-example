This example shows how to realize headers in the margin of pages.
It was first published at [my blog falkschoenfeld.com](http://hawksnest.hexspace.de/articles/14).

It is just a proof of concept and not under active development, but I'm always grateful for pull requests or suggestions for improvements.
